Historical Load of Cornell Coursework
=====================================

This is a repository of some of the work I completed in the Information Science major while at Cornell University between 2013 and 2016. This is a historical load, meaning that git history is generally not included, although many of these were hosted on BitBucket or Git repositories at the time the projects were developed, but are no longer available due to access issues, deleted accounts, etc.

A couple of the original repos can still be found on [my old BitBucket profile](https://bitbucket.org/lukegood712/). I will do my best to include the names of other contributors in READMEs for each project as I create or update them.
