Description of Design Exercise 1:

Admittedly, I first set out to build a three button Simon game, where the user
watches a pattern of colored lights and repeats it with the buttons, imitating
progressively longer sequences. However, after realizing that our kit did not
contain three buttons, I built a derivative game that is like a combination of
Simon and Bop It.

Like in Simon, a user watches a pattern of flashing lights (red, green, or blue),
starting with one, and if the user correctly repeats the pattern, show longer
sequences. Instead of three buttons, the user has three different inputs: a red
button (representing the red light), a IR range sensor (representing the green
light, and a blue potentiometer (representing the blue light).

Any significant change from the default state of the IR sensor is equivalent to
what would be a button push. The same goes for any change from the last recorded
state of the potentiometer.

The game begins upon Serial input of 's'. At each successful completion of a
a pattern, the Serial monitor displays a message saying which stage has been
completed, and if the user fails at all, the monitor immediately displays a
consolation message and ends the game. If the user wins however many stages
that the programmer defines, they get a victory message and the light flashes
quickly through the three colors for ~10 seconds.
