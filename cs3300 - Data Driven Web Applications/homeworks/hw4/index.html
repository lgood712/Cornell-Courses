<p id="p1"><b>Problem 1:</b> Revisiting HW2, Q5: Create three &lt;div> elements with class "findable". Using a single d3
function, select all the nodes with this class. Set the content of these nodes to "found", and
set the style to display in red text. Consult the d3js.org API documentation as necessary. (10
pts) <br>

<p id="p2"><b>Problem 2:</b> In problem 2 on HW3 you recreated Fig. 2 from the Wickham reading using SVG
elements. Now create the same plot again, but this time using d3 functions. First create x
and y scale functions that map from data coordinates to SVG coordinates (10 pts). Add
circles and rectangles, with positions given by the x and y scales. You don't need to use
data() or enter() functions: it's fine if you do a separate command for each shape (10
pts). Add d3 axes, again using the x and y scale functions (10 pts). Now add an event
listener that changes the color of a circles or rectangles to blue when it is clicked, using d3
selections (10 pts).<br>

<p id="p3"><b>Problem 3:</b> In this problem we're going to plot some data about English word frequencies from
Google Books. The file http://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/zipf.json contains a
Javascript snippet that defines an array of objects. Each object represents a word, sorted by
its frequency. The most frequent word, "of", occurs 15 billion times. The 512th most
frequent word, "middle", occurs 45 million times. Copy this snippet into a script element in
your homework document. Axes are not required for this problem, but you're welcome to
add them.<br>
<br>
A. Create a 200x200 pixel SVG element using d3 functions. Create two linear scale
functions: an x scale for the "rank" and a y scale for the "count". Choose the "range"
attributes to be appropriate for "rank" and "count". Use d3 to add text elements to the plot
for each word in the data set. Use a loop or a "forEach" statement; you may not use a
separate command for each word. Is this visualization useful? Why or why not? (10 pts)<br>
<div id="threeA"></div>
<b>This visualization is not the most useful as it does not clearly display the relative difference between 
word counts among the ranks after "at" which is ranked 16th. The word displays are crowded and offset horizontally 
is pretty negligible due to large range of ranks.</b>
<br>
B. In this section we'll transform the data as you create the text elements. Create a second
200x200 SVG element. Add the same points, but this time calculate the log of word's rank
(use Math.log()), convert that value to a pixel value with a linear scale, and set "x" to that
scaled log value. Similarly set "y" to the scaled log of the count. You will need to create new
x and y scale functions using appropriate values for the "domain". How does this version
differ from the previous version? (10 pts)<br>
<div id="threeB"></div>
<b>This version more clearly displays the Zipfian distribution of the word counts in relation to their rank.
It shows a logarithmic correlation between rank and relative word count in the corpus/document.</b>
<br>
C. Now rather than transforming the data, let's change the scale functions. Create a third
200x200 SVG element, and create two log scale functions using the same "domain" values
as in part A. See the d3js.org API documentation as necessary. Use d3 to add text elements
to this new plot, again using the original values for "rank" and "count". (10 pts)<br>

<p id="p4"><b>Problem 4:</b> Map yourself! Find the longitude and latitude coordinates of three places you have lived,
or want to live. Use d3 to create a map of the US or the world, as appropriate (10 pts). Use
the JSON geographic files included with the class notes on GitHub or find your own. Select a
projection for the map. Consult the d3 documentation for options. If you choose, you may
want to use one of the projections from the d3-geo-projection package, which will require
an additional javascript library file, available at https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection/.
Place colored circles and text labels on the map in the locations you selected. (10 pts) <br>
