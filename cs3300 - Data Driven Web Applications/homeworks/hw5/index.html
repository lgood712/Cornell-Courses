<h1>Luke Goodman (lng26) - INFO 3300 - HW5</h1>
<p id="p1"><strong>PROBLEM 1:</strong> What is the probability that you were at Sapsucker Woods, NOT considering any bird
sightings? (that is, calculate the prior probability that you went to Sapsucker Woods) (5 pts) <br><br>
Probability of being in Sapsucker Woods = P(SW)<br>
P(SW) + P(SW)/3 = 1.0<br>
<strong>P(SW) = 0.75</strong>
</p>

<p id="p2"><strong>PROBLEM 2:</strong> For each location and bird species, what is the probability that, if you select one of the
sightings from that location at random, it will be an instance of that species? (12 pts)<br>
<strong>Stewart Park</strong>
<ul>
<li>P(CG|SP) = 9000/10110 = ~0.89</li>
<li>P(BH|SP) = 35/10110 = ~0.0035</li>
<li>P(NP|SP) = 70/10110 = ~0.007</li>
<li>P(RTH|SP) = 40/10110 = ~0.004</li>
<li>P(PW|SP) = 15/10110 = ~0.0015</li>
<li>P(M|SP) = 950/10110 = ~0.094</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sapsucker Woods</strong>
<ul>
<li>P(CG|SW) = 300/761 = ~0.394</li>
<li>P(BH|SW) = 1/761 = ~0.0013</li>
<li>P(NP|SW) = 25/761 = ~0.033</li>
<li>P(RTH|SW) = 20/761 = ~0.0263</li>
<li>P(PW|SW) = 15/761 = ~0.0197</li>
<li>P(M|SW) = 400/761 = ~0.5256</li>
</ul>

</p>


<p id="p3"><strong>PROBLEM 3:</strong> Assume you are at Sapsucker Woods, and that bird sightings are independent. What is
the probability of seeing a red-tailed hawk and a pileated woodpecker, using the estimated
probabilities from the previous question? (that is, the conditional probability of the two bird
sightings given your location) (8 pts)<br><br>
P(RTH&PW | SW) = P(RTH|SW)*P(PW|SW) = 0.0263*0.0197 = <strong>0.000518</strong><br>

</p>


<p id="p4"><strong>PROBLEM 4:</strong> What is the probability of seeing a red-tailed hawk and a pileated woodpecker and being
at Sapsucker Woods? (that is, the joint probability of the sightings and the location) (5 pts) <br><br>
P(RTH&PW&SW) = 0.75*0.0263*0.0197 = <strong>0.0003886</strong>

</p>

<p id="p5"><strong>PROBLEM 5:</strong> Write a javascript function "logProb" that takes two arguments, a location and an array of
bird species (for example ["CG", "BH", "NP"]), and returns the log of the probability of those
events using the probabilities you estimated in the previous questions. The function should
support passing an empty array [] of sightings. (16 pts)<br><br>
<script>
var logProb = function(loc, birds) {
	var probs;
	if (loc == 'Stewart Park') {
		probs = {'loc':0.25, 'CG': 0.89, 'BH': 0.0035, 'NP': 0.007, 'RTH': 0.004, 'PW': 0.0015, 'M': 0.094};
	} else {
		probs = {'loc':0.75, 'CG': 0.394, 'BH': 0.0013, 'NP': 0.033, 'RTH': 0.0263, 'PW': 0.0197, 'M': 0.5256};
	}
	var p = probs['loc'];
	for (i in birds) {
		p = p*probs[birds[i]];
	}
	return Math.log(p);
}
</script>
</p>

<p id="p6"><strong>PROBLEM 6:</strong> Now let's consider your mystery birding trip. Compute the probability of seeing those six
species assuming you were at Sapsucker Woods and then again assuming you were at Stewart Park. 
Use the function you created in Q5 to calculate, for both locations, the log probabilities of seven observation arrays, 
starting with the empty array and adding one bird species each time: 
[], ["CG"], ["CG", "BH"], ..., ["CG", "BH", "NP", "RTH", "PW", "M"]. 
(14 pts, you may combine your answer with the answer for the next problem.)<br>
<p id="p7"><strong>PROBLEM 7:</strong> Write a JSON array with one element for each of the observation arrays in the previous
problem. Each element should be an object with three properties: the name of the bird
species added (use "Prior" for the first element), and the log probability values you
calculated for the two sites that you calculated in the previous problem. (5 pts) <br>
</p>
<strong>Stewart Park</strong>
<ul id="stew"></ul>
<strong>Sapsucker Woods</strong>
<ul id="sap"></ul>
<script>
	var birds = ["CG", "BH", "NP", "RTH", "PW", "M"]
	var stew = d3.select("#stew");
	var sap = d3.select("#sap");
	var ind;
	var json = []; //for P7
	//P6 adding to html lists
	stew.append("li").text("log(P(SP)) = " + logProb("Stewart Park", []));
	sap.append("li").text("log(P(SW)) = " + logProb("Sapsucker Woods", []));
	//P7
	json.push({"species": "Prior", 
					"stewProb": logProb("Stewart Park", []),
					"sapProb": logProb("Sapsucker Woods", [])
					});
	//P6 adding to html lists
	for (i in birds) {
		ind = parseInt(i) + 1;
		stew.append("li").text("log(P(" + birds.slice(0, ind) + "|SP)) = " + logProb("Stewart Park", birds.slice(0, ind)));
		sap.append("li").text("log(P(" + birds.slice(0, ind) + "|SW)) = " + logProb("Sapsucker Woods", birds.slice(0, ind)));
		//P7 adding to json object array
		json.push({"species": birds[i], 
					"stewProb": logProb("Stewart Park", birds.slice(0, ind)),
					"sapProb": logProb("Sapsucker Woods", birds.slice(0, ind))
					});
	}
</script>
</p>

<p id="p8"><strong>PROBLEM 8:</strong> Create a line plot that shows how each observed species changes the difference between
the log probabilities of the sequence of species at the two locations. Make a d3 ordinal axis
with the sequence of species ("Prior", "CG", "B", ..., "M") on the x-axis. Make a scale for the
y-axis centered at 0 for the difference in log probabilities. Use d3 "line" to show the log
probability of the observations so far assuming you were at Sapsucker Woods minus the log
probability of the same observations assuming you were at Stewart Park. (30 pts)<br><br>
<div id="eight"></div>
<script>
var height = 300,
	width = 500,
	padding = 40,
	linegraph = d3.select("#eight").append("svg")
					.attr("height", height).attr("width", width);

birds.unshift("Prior"); //adding "Prior" to beginning of birds list
var xScale = d3.scale.ordinal()
	.domain(birds).rangeRoundBands([0 + padding, width - 10]);

var yScale = d3.scale.linear()
	.domain([d3.min(json, function (d) { return -Math.abs(d.stewProb - d.sapProb); }),
		d3.max(json, function (d) { return Math.abs(d.stewProb - d.sapProb); })])
	.range([height - 10, 10]);

var xAxis = d3.svg.axis().scale(xScale);
linegraph.append("g")
  .attr("class", "axis")
  .attr("transform", "translate(0, " + (height - 10)/2 + ")")
  .call(xAxis);

var yAxis = d3.svg.axis().scale(yScale).orient("left");
linegraph.append("g")
	.attr("class", "axis")
	.attr("transform", "translate(" + padding + ", 0)")
	.call(yAxis);

var lineFunc = d3.svg.line()
	.x(function(d) {	return xScale(d.species); })
	.y(function(d) { return yScale(d.sapProb - d.stewProb); })
	.interpolate('linear');

linegraph.append('svg:path')
  .attr('d', lineFunc(json))
  .attr('stroke', 'blue')
  .attr('stroke-width', 2)
  .attr('fill', 'none')
  .attr("transform", "translate(" + padding + ", 0)");

<p id="p9"><strong>PROBLEM 9:</strong> Which site is more likely to have been the location of your trip? Which observation(s) has/
have the most effect on the final difference in log probabilities? Which have the least effect?
Does the prior affect your final guess? (5 pts) <br><br>
<strong>
Sapsucker Woods was more likely the location of the trip. All of the observations following
the addition of the northern pintail (RTH, PW, and M) had the most significant effect on the 
final difference as they showed substantial increases in the difference in favor of Sapsucker. The addition of the Canada
 goose and bufflehead are the least significant and they are both small movements in favor of Stewart Park. 
The prior does contribute a significant amount to favoring Sapsucker initially, and provides a strong weighting 
system biased towards Sapsucker as species probabilities are added.
