<p id="p1"><b>Problem 1:</b> Create a 200x200 pixel SVG element with the word "Cornell" in red, centered in
the exact middle (vertically and horizontally), using the Palatino typeface. Consult
the SVG specification to find out how to change color and font attributes and set
text alignment. Put a small blue circle at 100,100 so we can see that your text is
centered. If you do not have Palatino, you may use another font to test your code.

<p id="p2"><b>Problem 2:</b>  Create a 200x200 pixel SVG element. Reproduce the plot in Figure 2 of the
Wickham "Layered Grammar of Graphics" reading using SVG elements. Recalculate
the pixel positions for the (x, y) coordinates in Table 2 as necessary. Remember to
account for the "padding" pixels below and to the left of the axes. You do NOT need
to include the short tick marks. Table 2 contains data values. Table 3 contains those
data values transformed into pixel coordinates. You will need to recalculate these
pixel coordinates. The result may not look exactly like Figure 2. We will know what
to expect for the data in Table 2. (20pts)<br>

<p id="p3"><b>Problem 3:</b> In class we created a plot that looked not unlike the Japanese flag. Use SVG
<path> elements to create the Chinese flag (five yellow stars on red). You may
substitute another flag as long as it has elements that require a path, not just
rectangles (eg Canada, but not France). The flag should be recognizable, but does
not have to be precise. Hint: make one star, copy it several times, and then use
some combination of translate() and scale() transformations. (20pts)<br>

<p id="p4"><b>Problem 4:</b> Make a histogram that represents the frequency of numbers in this dataset:
var samples = [7, 4, 5, 3, 15, 5, 7, 3, 4, 2, 15, 4, 5, 5, 5];
The x-axis will correspond to values from the dataset, and the y-axis will correspond
to the frequency of those values. Figure out how to map those numbers into pixel
coordinates. Consider the following dataset:<br>
A. Make a histogram of the data values using SVG rectangles (labels optional).
Create one rectangle for each distinct value in the dataset. Each one should be
positioned so that it is centered at the x-axis value that corresponds to its data
value. For example, the middle of the bar for "5" should be at the pixel coordinate
that corresponds to the value 5. In other words, leave empty space even for values
that have no observations: there should be a gap between the bars for 7 and 15.
(20pts)<br>
B. Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation and record those
numbers in the <p> tag. You may use whatever tool you like, we only need to see
the result. (5 pts)<br>
C. Add vertical lines to the plot corresponding to the mean (in red), median (in blue)
and mode (in purple). For the "mean" line, make a line from the top of the figure to
the bottom, at the x position in the figure that corresponds to the mean you
calculated. If you find that two lines are at the same x position, you can either add a
slight offset (this is known as "jitter") or make one of the lines wider than the other.
(5 pts)<br>
D. Use an SVG rectangle with a semi-transparent fill to show the region covering one
standard deviation on both sides of the mean. In other words, make a rectangle
from the top of the figure to the bottom that is centered at the mean, and two
standard deviations wide. (5pts)<br>
E. Calculate the probability that a randomly selected datapoint is equal to 5 and
record it in the &lt;p> tag. (5pts)<br>
