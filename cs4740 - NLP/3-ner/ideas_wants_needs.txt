Needs:
    -Extension! MEMM? Larger n-grams? Different smoothing?
        - pos|tag emissions might already count as a small extension

Wants:
    -Calculate precision, recall, and F1 for validation sets
    -Switch word to pos

Ideas:
    -Incorporate pos|tag emissions (DONE: improved Kaggle score >40%, still only 75.7% though)
    -Incorporate known entities from training into viterbi paths, could also help in identifying full paths if done correctly
        i.e. Set parts of path that are known entities, then viterbi around/through them
    -Somehow combine the matrix updates into one loop/function for efficiency?
